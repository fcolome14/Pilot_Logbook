## Pilot's Logbook

This is a personal project based on the development of a [pilot's logbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_logbook) using VBA coding to use a Microsoft Excel interface.
The aim of this project is providing to pilots a simple and intuitive tool to fill up their flights registers in a faster way. 
Also the spreadsheet allows checking the flown hoursfor different scenarios and conditions.
